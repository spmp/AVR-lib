AVR-lib
=======
This repo is a colection of _drivers_ for the Atmel AVR micro - specifically the ATMega328p found on Arduino Nano boards.

The drivers are largely derivative works based on the competent code of others:

1. USART - Originally by Brendan Bycroft (`usart.h`)
2. Timers and PWM (`timers.h`)
3. Clock - Originally by Brendan Bycroft (`clock.h`)
4. ADC (`adc.h`)
5. I2C - Based heavily on twimaster by Peter Fleury (`i2c_safe.h`)
6. DS2482 - From everywhere, currently not working with I2C lib... (`ds2482.h`)
